# Setup
Step 1:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Step 2: Open `gptforjob_v2.ipynb`

# Modification before running
Change `url` to whatever job you want to apply to
Change `filename` to resume you want to check

# Disclaimer
- It is based on Cohere LLM, or simply put AI which may not always be (ironically) intelligent, so the outputs are sometimes generic.
- The AI is *not* specifically trained for resume matching, but does a fair job, but then again, may not always be perfect.

# Roadmap
(If  I still remain interested)
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Training an LLM on resume matching
