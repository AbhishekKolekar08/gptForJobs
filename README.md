# Setup
Step 1:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Step 2: Open `gptforjob_v2.ipynb`

# Modification before running
- Change `url` to whatever job you want to apply to
- Change `filename` to resume you want to check

# Disclaimer
- It is based on [Cohere LLM](https://cohere.com/), or simply put AI which may not always be (ironically) intelligent, so the outputs are sometimes generic.
- The AI is *not* specifically trained for resume matching, but does a fair job, but then again, may not always be perfect.
- The code uses my personal API key

# Roadmap
(If  I still remain interested)
- [ ] v3 - Has GUI (non functional right now)
- [ ] v4 - Training an LLM on resume matching
