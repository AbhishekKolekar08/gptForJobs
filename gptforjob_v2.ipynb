       "\n",
       "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
       "- **Calibration:** While your resume doesn't explicitly mention calibration, it is a critical aspect of ADAS and autonomous systems. Consider adding any experience or projects related to sensor calibration, model calibration, or system tuning. For example, if you have calibrated camera or radar sensors for ADAS applications, it would be beneficial to include this.\n",
       "- **Autonomous Driving:** The job description emphasizes autonomous driving, so it would be advantageous to highlight any projects or coursework related to this field. Even if you haven't worked directly on autonomous vehicles, you could emphasize your understanding of ADAS as a stepping stone towards full autonomy.\n",
       "- **Innovation and Quality:** These aspects could be enhanced by providing more details about how your projects or ideas contributed to innovative solutions or improved quality. For instance, you could elaborate on how your MATLAB model for rolling resistance calculation brought a novel approach to energy efficiency assessments.\n",
       "- **Communication and Collaboration:** While you've demonstrated teamwork through your Formula Student experiences, emphasizing your communication skills and ability to collaborate in a diverse team would be beneficial. You could add a brief description of your role in facilitating effective communication and collaboration within your Formula Student team.\n",
