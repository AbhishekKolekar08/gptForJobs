       "\n",
       "Your resume is impressive and demonstrates a strong background in automotive engineering, with a clear focus on vehicle dynamics and control systems. Here's a breakdown of the scoring:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **HIL Test Engineering (10/10):** Your experience with Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing for motor control and establishing CAN protocol communication is highly relevant and valuable for the role. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Automotive Industry (8/10):** With your Master's Thesis and projects at Volvo Car Corporation, you have direct industry experience, which is a significant advantage. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Embedded Systems (7/10):** While not explicitly mentioned, your work with MATLAB, VI-CarRealTime, and control systems suggests a good understanding of embedded systems. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Test Benches (7/10):** Your involvement in various testing processes, including on-site rolling resistance tests and HIL testing, aligns well with this requirement. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Analytical Skills, Problem-Solving, Teamwork, and Communication (6/10 each):** These skills are evident throughout your resume, especially in your project descriptions and leadership roles in Formula Student teams. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **English Proficiency (5/10):** As you have indicated proficiency in English and have studied/worked in an English-speaking environment, this should not be a concern. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Electrical Engineering (4/10 each):** Your programming skills (Python, C++, MATLAB) and experience with software tools (Gitlab, Docker) are relevant, but a more detailed description of your software development or electrical engineering tasks could further strengthen your application. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendations for Resume Improvements:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Technical Skills Section:** Consider adding a dedicated section for technical skills, where you can list all the software tools, programming languages, and engineering tools you are proficient in. This will make it easier for the hiring manager to assess your technical abilities at a glance. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "    Technical Skills:\n",
       "    - MATLAB/Simulink\n",
       "    - Python\n",
       "    - C++\n",
       "    - SOLIDWORKS\n",
       "    - CATIA V5\n",
       "    - ANSYS Mechanical\n",
       "    - Gitlab, Docker, Jenkins (CI/CD)\n",
       "    - INCA, MDA, IPG CarMaker\n",
       "    - VI-CarRealTime\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Project Impact and Achievements:** While your resume provides a good overview of your projects, try to quantify your achievements and the impact of your work. For instance, mention any significant improvements, cost savings, or innovative solutions you contributed to. Hiring managers often look for tangible results and value-added by potential candidates.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Reorder Sections:** You might consider rearranging the sections to bring more attention to your most relevant experiences. For this particular job, you could move the 'Professional Experience' section above 'Education' to highlight your industry projects first. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Keywords and Buzzwords:** Ensure that you use industry-specific keywords and buzzwords throughout your resume, especially in the project descriptions. For instance, emphasize your work with 'embedded control systems,' 'real-time simulations,' 'vehicle prototyping,' or 'model-based design.' These terms can help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems and catch the hiring manager's attention."
